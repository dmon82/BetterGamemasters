# BetterGamemasters
Wurm Unlimited mod(s) focusing on in-game utility for staff/Gamemasters

* No 100 item limit in inventory.
* Not slowed by weight (doesn't work anymore).
* No carry weight limits.
* No material requirements for floors and ceilings, and instant building.
* No damage on items owned by gamemasters.

# Requirements
You'll need ago's mod loader https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher/releases  
This was built on mod loader version v0.20-133d216.  
This was built on Wurm Unlimited 1.1.1.1.

# Installation
Extract the release archive into the Wurm Unlimited server directory, it should create a directory structure like .\Wurm Unlimited server directory\mods\modname.properties (file), and .\Wurm Unlimited server directory\mods\modname\modname.jar (file).

On Windows I'd recommend using 7-Zip, on *nix I'd use tar (tar -xvf modname.tar.gz targetpath/).
